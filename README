"spectatom" is based on Ondrej Certik's spectral FEM code "featom."

Description:
------------
The main program script "spectatom.m" can be run for any input 
atomic number (1-92) which is represented as the variable Zion.

                        ===================
                        **** IMPORTANT ****
                        =================== 
Before executing any of the scripts from wither /src or /test directory, 
run the spectatomstartup.m function on the home directory. This sets up 
the PATH correctly so that any of the routines in /src can be called from 
any directory not included in /src.  

***************************************************************************
After setting up the mesh (options: uniform/logarithmic/exponential) 
and quadrature (options: Gauss-Legendre/ Gauss-Legendre-Lobatto)
"spectatom" calls the function "radialdft.m." radialdft.m initializes 
charge density (as per Thomas-Fermi approximation) and pass on the same, 
alongside other problem-set up variables to the function "KSscfiteration.m."

KSscfiteration.m performs the SCF iterations. To this end, at every step of 
the iteration, it first solves the radial-Poisson problem 
(functions: "solveradialpoisson.m" and "radialpoissonelemeqns.m") for a 
given input density and subsequently the solution (Hartree potential) gets 
used to compute Hamiltonian matrix. The functions: 
"radialschroedingerelemeqns.m" and "solveradialschroed.m" constructs and 
solves the radial Kohn-Sham eigenvalue problem (which in essence is same 
as radial Schrodinger equation) respectively. 

Only those eigenpairs which are needed to construct the output density 
are computed in solveradialschroed.m. Lastly, total energy is computed 
by the function "computetotalenergy.m" and convergence is accessed based 
on the difference betweek input and output density. If not achieved then 
the SCF iteration continues. 


Test: (Incomplete, 07/25/17)
----------------------------
1. Execute the "spectatom.m" file. Changing the variable Zion changes 
the atomic number of the system (element). 
The electronic configuration of the corresponding element can also be 
found in the function "getatomicstate.m." 

The main output of the code is the ground state energy. For benchmarking 
purpose please refer to the NIST database: 
https://www.nist.gov/pml/data/atomic-total-energies-and-eigenvalues-html
where a list of gound state energies (among other details) for all 
atoms is maintained.

An offline version of this data is also kept in the directory: ./NISTdata

FUTURE WORK:
------------
1. Add Pulay mixing to accelerate SCF convergence
2. Patch lobpcg.m routine (@/src/eigensolver) to improve the eigensolver 
   performance at higher DOFs
